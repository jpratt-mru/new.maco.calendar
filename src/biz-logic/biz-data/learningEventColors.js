/**
 * These are the colors used for events.
 * I wanted something easily ditinguishable.
 *
 * When the events on a calendar need to be chosen, colors are chosen
 * from here from start of the color array to the end.
 *
 * You can generate some others here: http://colorbrewer2.org/?type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=9#type=qualitative&scheme=Accent&n=8
 * There's a nice export to JS array feature.
 *
 * I removed #ffff99 (a pale yellow), because I didn't like it.
